Intended to allow connection to a server even when auth servers are unreachable.  
The goal is to just to add a bit of auth to offline-mode, while allowing normal online connections.

Offline logins can also be restricted by a registration password  
by creating `ocaip/password` and putting the password inside



Originally called Offline Customization And Identification Protocol because the acronym kindof sounded like "Oh, Cape" (due to the migrator cape).  
It's not really valid anymore since i didn't add cape customization, still keeping the acronym.
